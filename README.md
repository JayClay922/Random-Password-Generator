# Random-Password-Generator

## Project

This project required creating an application with which an employee could use ot generate a random password, based on criteria they've selected by modifying a starter code given to us. The application will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code that I will write.

## Acceptance Criteria

In creating the application, there are certain criteria that had to be met to ensure that the application fulfilled it's expected behaviour. And they were:
1. To generate a password when the button is clicked.
2. Present a series of prompts for password criteria. These password criterias are:
   - Enter the desired password length(It should be no more than '64 characters' and not less than '10 characters'.
   - Do you want to include lower case characters?
   - Do you want to include upper case characters?
   - Do you want to include numeric characters?
   - Do you want to include special characters?
3. The code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
4. Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Outcome

This challenge was certainly challenging, however I was able to acheive the desired outcome.
1. I was able to write code that will prompt the user to type in how long they wanted their generated password to be, and if they choose any number outside of the parameters given there would be an alert to remind them that the password should be no more than 64 character and no less than 10 characters.

2. I wrote code that was able to prompt users as to if they wanted to include either numeric, lowercase, uppercase and/or special characters in their generated password. They have to pick atleast one of the options presented to them.

3. The code was able to validate each input, including how long they want their password to be.

4. Lastly, once all prompts are answered the password is then generated to the page.
